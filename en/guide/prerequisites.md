# Go
Minotaur currently requires [Go](https://go.dev/) version [1.22](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.22.0) or above.

# Generics
Minotaur makes extensive use of generics, so it is essential to understand the relevant concepts.

[Tutorial: Getting started with generics](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/generics)

# Getting Minotaur

To get Minotaur from `Github` using `go get`:

```shell
go get -u github.com/kercylan98/minotaur@develop
```

If you are in China and cannot access `Github`, you can try obtaining it via the [`GOPROXY.IO`](https://goproxy.io/docs/getting-started.html) proxy.

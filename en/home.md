# Introduction

Welcome to Minotaur! This is a distributed service development support library designed in Go language, providing simple yet powerful concurrency and distributed solutions through an Actor model specifically designed for Go. While Minotaur is primarily aimed at game development, many of its features are also suitable for web development.

# Why Choose Minotaur?
In modern computer architecture, many traditional programming models and practices cannot address the key challenges faced when designing systems. To ensure the success of a distributed system, issues like component failure, message loss, and network latency must be addressed. Minotaur offers the following advantages:

- Designed for Go: Leveraging the high concurrency features of Go, the Actor model implementation is optimized to ensure efficient and reliable system operation.
- Simplified Concurrent Programming: Through the Actor model, there is no need for complex concurrency constructs, thus avoiding issues such as memory visibility.
- Transparent Remote Communication: Achieves transparent remote communication between system components, simplifying network code writing and maintenance.
- High Availability and Scalability: Supports distributed, cluster architectures to ensure the system always maintains high responsiveness and flexibility.

# Key Features
Minotaur provides a comprehensive set of tools to address common issues in distributed and parallel systems. These tools are tightly integrated into a unified programming model, ensuring efficiency and consistency in system design. Key features include:

- Actor Model Designed for Go: Through an abstraction layer, making it easier to write concurrent, parallel, and distributed systems.
- Efficient Concurrency Handling: Fully utilizes Go's goroutines and channels for efficient concurrency handling.
- Utility Function Library: Contains a large number of practical tools tailored for the gaming domain, simplifying the development process.
- Distributed Support: Built-in support for distributed systems, facilitating the construction of complex distributed applications.

# Getting Started
If you are using Minotaur for the first time, we recommend following our suggested sequence. The examples will guide you through understanding the Actor system, Actors, messages, and the built-in functions for quickly setting up servers, enabling you to quickly get started and understand its structure.
